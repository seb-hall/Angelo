<h1>Angelo Graphics</h1>

Angelo is a cross-platform compatibility layer for low-level graphics drawing. Intended to be used as part of the UniversalUI framework, it uses native frameworks and libraries to implement the drawing, abstracting and converting their commands into platform-independant code.

For now, Angelo is 2D only but we plan to expand it to 3D graphics for more complex applications.

<h3>Current Implementations</h3>

- Desktop Linux: Cairo (GTK)
- MacOS, iOS and iPadOS: CoreGraphics
- Windows: WPF
- Android: Native
- Web: HTML5 Canvas
